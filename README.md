## Description
Kick Out Hunger is an organization that is aimed at ending Campus Hunger. We recognize that due to the prevailing hard economic times a lot of students in Universities  are going without daily consistent meals. This misfortune has led to students performing poorly or dropping out of school. 

- Kenyan university students face significant food security challenges, with many struggling to afford nutritious meals due to high tuition fees and living expenses. 

- This financial strain often forces students to skip meals or rely on inadequate, low-cost food options. The lack of consistent access to healthy food affects their academic performance and overall well-being. 

- Addressing this issue is crucial to ensuring that students can focus on their studies and achieve their full potential.
