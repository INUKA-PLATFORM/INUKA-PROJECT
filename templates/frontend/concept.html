            <h1>Project Concept Note</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>Project Inuka is a transformative university feeding program designed 
            to support students from less fortunate backgrounds who struggle to afford daily meals 
            at the campus cafeteria. Recognizing that proper nutrition is vital for academic success 
            and overall well-being, Project Inuka provides a sustainable solution to ensure no student 
            has to go hungry. By leveraging the power of community and the generosity of well-wishers, 
            corporate partners, and alumni, Project Inuka aims to create a supportive environment where 
            every student can thrive.
